# Random123

Tracking D. E. Shaw Research's Random123 Library from their paper
"Parallel Random Numbers: As Easy as 1, 2, 3".

## What is this?

This is a verbatim, unmodified copy of the Random123 Library
as described in the paper
[\[SMDS11\]](https://doi.org/10.1145/2063384.2063405) 
by John K. Salmon, Mark A. Moraes, Ron O. Dror, and David E. Shaw. 
[free copy](https://www.thesalmons.org/john/random123/papers/random123sc11.pdf).

Documentation is available in the /docs directory,
and also [online](https://www.thesalmons.org/john/random123/releases/latest/docs/index.html).

The version in this repository has been released on Salmon's
[website](https://www.deshawresearch.com/resources_random123.html).

Currently tracked version: **Random123-1.13.2** (0.7 MB, Mar 22, 2019)

### Reasons for this repository

While there are some github repositories with Random123 like
  * [quinoacomputing/Random123](https://github.com/quinoacomputing/Random123)
  * [DEShawResearch/Random123-Boost](https://github.com/DEShawResearch/Random123-Boost)

none of them are tracking current versions.

Use this repository if you wish to add current random123 as an
external dependency to your project with "git submodule add".

Of course, you can alternatively simply fetch Random123-1.13.2.tar.gz from
Salmon's website and drop it right into your source tree, if you prefer
not to trust this repository. I haven't changed anything (except adding this
README.md file), but don't take my word for it.
